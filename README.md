Features
Scene Graph Implementation
Parent-child relationships allow hierarchical transformations.

Example: The Moon orbits Earth, and Earth orbits the Sun.
Lighting
Diffuse and specular lighting are implemented using the Phong reflection model for realistic shading.

The Sun, Earth, and Mars rotate independently around the Z-axis.
Mars rotates at 1.5 times the Sun's rotation speed.
Texturing
Realistic textures applied to celestial objects:

Sun: Texture Link
Earth: Texture Link
Moon: Texture Link
Mars: Texture Link
